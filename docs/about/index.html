    <img src="/static/images/hero/JB_redwood2.JPG" style="width:500px; float: left; display: inline-block; margin: 10px;">
    <p><span style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 200">Jovanka</span> was born
    in Panama and immigrated to the United States when she was 9. Her
    step-father was in the military and the family lived in many different
    places, which taught her to be flexible and exposed her to a diversity of
    people, cultures and ways of life. She learned how to get along with and
    work closely with others. She attended the HBCU (Historically Black College
    and University), Florida A&amp;M University, on a full-ride basketball
    scholarship. She majored in psychology as an undergraduate and later earned
    an MBA. Jovanka has worked for decades in public health as a mental health
    clinician. She works with some of the most negatively impacted impoverished
    and marginalized children and families in Contra Costa County.</p>

    <p>It was after experiencing a life-altering home invasion by desperate
    young people, that Jovanka was directly impacted by the profound needs of
    our growing marginalized communities. She felt moved to run for political
    office where she knew she could make a difference as an elected official
    who could deliver results for those with the greatest needs. And deliver
    results she did!  Rather than to propose carceral and punitive
    consequences, Jovanka has been a vocal and active advocate for the working
    class, the poor, the unhoused, those at risk of incarceration and returning
    citizens looking for a second chance. Recognizing that the underlying needs
    of struggling community members must be met, Jovanka fought for, created
    and supported policies that include: banning the box on City job
    applications; providing any community member who wanted one a local
    identification card, pushing for and winning a fight for rent control and
    raising the minimum wage.</p>

    <p>A team player, Jovanka campaigned for several progressive candidates
    locally, regionally, statewide and nationally, before running for office
    herself. With a deep desire to make a difference in her community, she was
    appointed by the Richmond Mayor to the Economic Development Commission and
    years later, she was appointed to the City’s Planning Commision. In 2010,
    she was elected to the Richmond City Council where she was able to deliver
    results while actively serving two terms. During this time, in addition to
    the policies mentioned above, Jovanka was instrumental in raising awareness
    through education campaigns and holding corporate polluters accountable.
    Broadening her geographical scope and ability to make a difference for more
    people, she was elected to the AC Transit Board in 2020. She continues to
    deliver results for her city, for two counties, for transit riders and
    transit workers.</p>
    <p>Jovanka knows that everyone needs and deserves to be served by
    courageous leaders. She intends to continue to be a leader who can be
    trusted to deliver on her promises. She will be a Senator who can both lead
    and deliver results. Jovanka believes that leadership must courageously
    work on the issues that affect the majority of us. These issues include
    reparations, housing, healthcare for all, free college and childcare,
    reforming prop 13, enshrining the right to same sex marriage and taxing the
    rich.</p>

    <p>Jovanka recognizes that California is a uniquely diverse state. She
    knows that this diversity is not reflected in the State Senate. The current
    makeup of the California State Senate has only 2 Black legislators. This
    does not reflect the diversity of the State. The East Bay is made up of
    multiple diverse communities and folks living here deserve a representative
    who represents the diversity of the region. Black and Brown people deserve
    a place at the table. Immigrants and women deserve a seat at the table. The
    LGBTQ+ community deserves a place at the table.</p>

    <p>Jovanka is a Black Latinx immigrant, a proud queer spouse, mother and
    grandmother. The East Bay deserves a Senator whose lived experience
    reflects theirs.</p>

    <p>Jovanka’s progressive activism has gained her local and national
    recognition. Images of her activism can be seen in The National Museum of
    African American History and Culture in Washington DC and locally in the
    Oakland Museum of California’s Installation of Hella Feminist.  She also
    gained national recognition for her Ban the box initiative in Richmond.</p>

    <p>Jovanka is ready to make District 7 and California a district and state
    that works for the many and not just the few. She has a proven track record
    that delivers results for the working class; for homeowners, for renters,
    for the poor, for immigrants, for returning citizens, for safer
    communities, for the LGBTQ+ community, for women’s rights, for transit
    riders. With your support, she will deliver results. Together we can!</p>
