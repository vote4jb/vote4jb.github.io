        <h1>A letter from Director Beckles</h1>

        <h3>Dear Friends,</h3>

        <p>Welcome to my senatorial campaign!</p>

        <p>For more than a decade I’ve proudly served the East Bay fighting for
        working families, a clean environment, safety and equity.</p>

        <p>As a Richmond City Council member, I helped usher in a suite of
        progressive reforms that transformed our City — collecting $100 million
        in new taxes from Chevron, instituting a $15 minimum wage, creating the
        first California rent control in thirty years. I’m especially proud of
        our groundbreaking “Ban the Box” legislation, which allows formerly
        incarcerated people to seek work with dignity.</p>

        <p>Despite a multimillion-dollar campaign against my re-election, I won
        a second term and went on to work with my colleagues on the Council and
        the Richmond Progressive Alliance to bring about real progressive
        change. I am not afraid to stand up to powerful interests to protect
        the rights of those whose voices are not being heard.</p>

        <p>Currently I sit on the AC Transit Board, Ward 1, where I have
        continued bringing in progressive values and equity for transit
        users.</p>

        <p>Now I’m running for State Senate, to become the only first Black
        Latina, LGBTQ, immigrant to the California State Senate. and to bring
        true, progressive representation to all of District 7 (formerly
        District 9, served by Nancy Skinner whose term is ending in 2024).</p>

        <p>Please join this innovative, transformative campaign:
            People powered and corporate free.</p>
