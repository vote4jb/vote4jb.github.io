<p>Jovanka Beckles is a movement organizer, a former two-term Richmond City
Councilmember, a longtime leader in the Richmond Progressive Alliance, a
children’s mental health professional, a former candidate for California’s 15th
State Assembly district, and a democratic socialist in the tradition of Martin
Luther King, Jr. She is running for AC Transit Board to fight for the labor
rights of transit workers and the green, fare-free, universally accessible
transit system that the East Bay’s working people deserve.</p>

<p>Born in Panama City, Panama, Jovanka came to the United States with her parents
in 1972. Her love of basketball and sportsmanship won her a full scholarship to
Florida A&amp;M University, and her dedication to people in need inspired her to
earn a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and pursue a career in mental health and
social work. She later pursued a Master of Business Administration.</p.

<p>As a health professional in Richmond, Jovanka quickly realized that she
could not sit by while her vibrant, working-class community suffered public
service cuts, crime, and pollution from the local Chevron refinery. So she
started to organize. When small businesses on San Pablo Avenue decided to take
power into their own hands and fight a crisis of violence, she helped to form a
merchants’ association. In 2010, she joined forces with the Richmond
Progressive Alliance (RPA) and was elected to the Richmond City Council on a
platform of corporate-free politics, labor rights, and environmental justice.
In 2014, despite the three million dollars spent by Chevron to elect her
opponents, Jovanka won a second term.</p>

<p>Chevron opposed Jovanka because she led on environmental issues. She
co-sponsored the Climate Emergency Declaration, opposed the transportation of
coal into Richmond, and voted against Chevron’s plan to produce dirtier crude
oil. Backed by a grassroots movement of working people, Jovanka helped pass a
suite of progressive reforms that transformed Richmond — including $100 million
in new taxes on Chevron, a $15 minimum wage, the first California rent control
in thirty years, and “ban the box” legislation allowing formerly incarcerated
people to seek work with dignity.</p>

<p>In 2018, Jovanka ran a people-powered, corporate-free campaign for State
Assembly. Her campaign was funded by small donors and ordinary people. She was
narrowly defeated by an establishment Democrat backed by millions of dollars
from billionaires, Republican donors, and corporate PACs.</p>

<p>Jovanka decided to run for AC Transit Board at the urging of the AC Transit
workers represented by Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 192. Jovanka had
spent the last decade fighting for the East Bay’s working families and standing
up to corporate interests, animated by the belief that only an organized
movement of the working class can win us the world we deserve, and she
proceeded bring this same dedication to the fight for a transit system that
works for everyone — riders and transit workers alike.</p>
