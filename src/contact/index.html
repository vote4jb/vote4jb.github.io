<p>If you’re interested in keeping tabs on our work or hearing about upcoming
events, email ___ or follow us on twitter ___</p>

<p>We’re a grass-roots, volunteer-oriented organization, which means
we need volunteers. This means we need you, a volunteer, to join! In
particular, we are in need of these roles:</p>

<li>Canvassers - Related to the senate campaign, you can participate by talking
to neighbors about this demand.</li>
<li>Communications - We publish articles, design graphics, maintain a Twitter feed,
and make memes.</li>

<p>With that being said, you don’t need any particular skills or even more than a
few hours to be a huge help to our movement. Power flows from the people, so
get involved! We strive to actively mentor. Email us at pta@eastbaydsa.org if
you are interested.</p>
