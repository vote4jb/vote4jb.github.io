    <p>If you’re interested in keeping tabs on our work or hearing about upcoming
    events, email us at the email found in the footer, or follow us on Twitter.</p>

    <p>We’re a grass-roots, volunteer-oriented organization, which means
    we need volunteers. This means we need you, a volunteer, to join! In
    particular, we are in need of these roles:</p>

    <li>Canvassers - Related to the senate campaign, you can participate by talking
    to neighbors about this demand.</li>
    <li>Communications - We publish articles, design graphics, maintain a Twitter feed,
    and make memes.</li>

    <p>With that being said, you don’t need any particular skills or even more than a
    few hours to be a huge help to our movement. Power flows from the people, so
    get involved! We strive to actively mentor.</p>
